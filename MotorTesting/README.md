## Motor testing
This is the testing of the barebones prototype without networking
On succesful run of [test_motor.py](test_motor.py), expect the motor to turn
On succesful run of [test_sensor.py](test_sensor.py), expect the ToF sensor to take 50 measurements

TODO list:
- ~~Connect HAT~~
- ~~Make motor turn with the Raspberry Pi power~~
- add magnetic connector set (Moved)
- ~~bring USB A male to USB C female~~
- Make motor turn with independant power from USB A hat output
- ~~add Tof Sensor to circuit~~
- Tof sensor should trigger an interupt when object is close and star again a delay
- Solder ToF sensor
- Add long wire strip for 4" column
