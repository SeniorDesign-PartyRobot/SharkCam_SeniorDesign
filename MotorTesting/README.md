## Motor testing
This is the testing of the barebones prototype without networking
On succesful run of [test_motor.py](test_motor.py), expect the motor to turn
On succesful run of [test_sensor.py](test_sensor.py), expect the ToF sensor to take 10 measurements

TODO list:
- ~~Connect HAT~~
- ~~Make motor turn without the independant power~~
- add magnetic connector set (Moved)
- ~~bring USB A male to USB C female~~
- Make motor turn without with the independant power 
- ~~add Tof Sensor to circuit~~
- feature that Tof measurements trigger an interupt object is close
- Solder ToF sensor
- Add long wire strip for column
