## Motor testing
This is the testing of the barebones prototype without networking
On succesful run of [test_motor.py](test_motor.py), expect the motor to do one rotation
On succesful run of [test_sensor.py](test_sensor.py), expect the ToF sensor to take 100 measurements

TODO list:
- ~~Connect HAT~~
- ~~Make motor turn with the Raspberry Pi power~~
- find a way user friendly way to detach motor wires
- ~~bring USB A male to USB C female~~
- ~~Make motor turn with independant power from USB A hat output~~
- ~~add Tof Sensor to circuit~~
- ~~Tof sensor should trigger an interupt when object is close ~~
- ~~Solder ToF sensor~~
- Add long wire strip to go up the 4" column
